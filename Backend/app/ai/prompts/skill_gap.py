---------------------------
Prompt specification for the AI Skill Gap Explanation feature (Phase 6B).

Uses PromptBuilder to construct prompts with proper trusted/untrusted
separation. The system instruction constrains the AI to explain — never
decide — and treats the platform-supplied match data as authoritative.

ARCHITECTURAL RULE: This module generates prompts; it never computes
scores, reads databases, or accesses authentication context.
